         Some notes:
         * gap: is required only on iOS (when using UIWebView) and is needed for JS->native communication
         * https://ssl.gstatic.com is required only on Android and is needed for TalkBack to function properly
         * Disables use of inline scripts in order to mitigate risk of XSS vulnerabilities. To change this:
         * Enable inline JS: add 'unsafe-inline' to default-src
